Hi, Welcome to my Portfolio.

I’m **Devendra Mishra** -an engineer who loves building systems that not only work but scale beautifully.  
By day, I work on crafting **resilient infrastructures**, **efficient backends**, and **smooth user experiences**.  
By night, I dive deeper into **System Design**, **Automation**, **exploring new technologies** and **AI Agents** that shape the future of software.

I’ve had the privilege of working on **Full-stack applications**, **DevOps pipelines, infrastructures**, and **real-time services** delivering solutions that are both **performant** and **reliable**.

For me, **systems are like symphonies**: harmonious when well-orchestrated, chaotic when not.
