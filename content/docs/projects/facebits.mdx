## About the Project

FaceBits began as a simple API‑based face registration and recognition service I built to streamline biometric workflows in my applications.

- I built endpoints to **register faces** and **manage users**.
- I used a **pretrained model** for recognition allowing anyone to get started without configuration.
- Integration is done purely via APIs, but I’ve built a **minimal SDK foundation** and plan to release a React‑focused package soon.

## My Roadmap

| Aspect                | Current                   | Next Steps                                                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Recognition Model** | Pretrained, cost‑free use | Custom ML models for paid users                                           |
| **Dashboard**         | Face and user management  | Add billing, usage insights                                               |
| **API Keys**          | Issue and revoke keys     | Add scoped access & usage limits                                          |
| **SDK**               | None Right Now            | Full React SDK and support libraries                                      |
| **Webhooks**          | Basic WebHook Support     | Ability to pass custom payloads and configure it according to your system |

## How I Use It

- Generate an **API key** to authenticate your calls.
- Use `POST /register` to add new faces.
- Use `POST /recognize`, and the pretrained model returns matching IDs and confidence scores.
- Can be embeded using iframes or custom forms to call facebits api and webhooks to manage your own database

## Why I Built It

I wanted a flexible, developer‑friendly way to manage facial data without dealing with UI-heavy platforms or proprietary constraints. FaceBits reflects my interest in **clean APIs**, **scalable architecture**, and **clear expansion paths** for users and myself.

## End Note

This project currently runs on free or low-tier hosting plans (e.g., shared hosting, managed DBs), which I personally cover. These free tiers are great for experimentation but can be unreliable—providers often limit resources, meaning the service may sometimes be unavailable.

If you're curious to try it out or see a live demo, drop me a message—I’d be happy to connect and walk you through it!
