## About the Project

I joined **HackTheWay** after realizing that despite my interest in cybersecurity, I never got the chance to learn it from a research or analyst standpoint‚Äîmy path eventually led me toward DevOps and software engineering. When a friend pitched the idea, I jumped in and took charge of building the platform.

HackTheWay was born to bridge that gap: creating a space where enthusiasts, students, and professionals can **learn, practice, and grow together** through hands-on security challenges and real-world scenarios.
