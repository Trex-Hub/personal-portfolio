title: My Tech Ecosystem
description: Tech Stack's I use throught the day.

I build most of my **full‑stack applications** using **TypeScript** alongside **Node.js and React.js frameworks**.

For **AI and automation**, I’ve significantly invested in **Python**, especially using **FastAPI**, to prototype AI‑powered workflows and data pipelines.

On the **DevOps** side, I rely on **Docker** containers, **GitHub Actions**, and cloud platforms such as Vercel, Railway, Render, Azure Cloud, AWS and Google Cloud to deploy, monitor, and scale my systems.

I’m currently exploring emerging frameworks for **AI Agents**—most notably **Mastra AI**, a TypeScript agent framework praised for its simplicity, workflow orchestration tools, and Type-safe DX —and **Agno**, which draws attention for its plug‑and‑play developer experience.
